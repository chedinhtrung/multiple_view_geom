    "### Projection Rectification\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Projection rectification is the process of undoing distortions to shapes, caused by projecting a 3D object down to a 2D image.\n",
    "Projection rectification can be achieved in several way, the simplest way is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marking 4 points in the original image, preferrably of a recognizable shape, like a square\n",
    "- Specifying the new coordinate of the 4 points that we want\n",
    "- Solving for the projective transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose points are $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ and $x_1', x_2', x_3', x_4'$, then: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Hx_i = x_i' \\to H\\cdot [x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4] = [x_1' \\ x_2' \\ x_3' \\ x_4']\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: $H$ is 3x3, but $[x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4]$ and $[x_1' \\ x_2' \\ x_3' \\ x_4']$ are 3x4. This is because $x_i$ are given in projective coordinates that is defined only up to scale.\n"
